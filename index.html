  			 <p> This is a story of a boy called&nbsp;Timothy,&nbsp;who used to play &#160;football&#160; all day with his friends. He was called &quot;El Phenomena&quot;, or &#34;The Phenomenon&#34; among his friends. Born in England&apos;s Birhimgham &amp;City, Timothy&#39;s family was poor. His family&#39;s financial state was not stable, so much so that he did not have even 50&cent; to spend on a football, let alone 10&euro;, which was the price of Nike&reg; boots. Nowadays, 50&#162 is a thing of the past as he earns 100,000&#8364;
  			 per week.
